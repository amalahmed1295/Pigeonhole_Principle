        "To clarify this principle, let us take the following example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose that there are 10 high school students, and each student has to choose at least one favorite subject from the nine given subjects: \"Qura'an\", \"Islamic\", \"Math\", \"History\", \"Geography\", \"Reading\", \"Literature and Rhetoric\", \"Sciences\", and \"English\". Note that a student is not allowed to choose more than one subject, and at the same time, he has to choose from the given subjects only. As long as we have 10 students and 9 subjects, at least one student will choose the same favorite subject as another student. In other words, there will be at least one duplicated subject in the form of n/m ≈ 2. The following code implements this example:"
