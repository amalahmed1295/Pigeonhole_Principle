        "In mathematics, Combinations are a way to calculate the total outcomes of an event where **order of the outcomes does not matter**. To calculate combinations, the formula **nCr = n! / r! * (n - r)!** is used, where n represents the total number of items, and r represents the number of items being chosen at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a permutation of a set is, an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order, or if the set is already ordered, a rearrangement of its elements. The word \"permutation\" also refers to the act or process of **changing the linear order of an ordered set**. To calculate permutations, the formula **nPr = n! / (n - r)!** is used, where n represents the total number of items, and r represents the number of items being chosen at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the following example:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the football world cup 6 teams are nominated for quarter finals: 'brazil', 'yemen', 'argentina', 'portugal', 'morroco', 'turkey' (generally 8 teams have to be nominated to quarter finals, but to make the reasults easier to represent we suppose there are only 6 teams). The user can choose how many teams he wants to choose from the set of teams to orgnize Sports Tournaments in terms of combinations or permutations.\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve this problem by code representation, instead of using ready librries, the code is formed of **multi recursion functions** to achive the factorial and multiplication properities found in the formula of both combination and permutation. In case if the choosen number is less than or equale to zero or exceeding the number of given teams, the code will ask the user to input a number in the given range. As long as nC1= n and nP1= n, in case of choosing r=1 then the result will be the 6 teams as sinlgle elemen 6 combinations/permutations.\n",
